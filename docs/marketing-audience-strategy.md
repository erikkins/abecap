## Platform Analysis

### Tier 1: Primary Channels (Active + Ad Spend)

#### Twitter/X — Best Channel for RigaCap

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why** | FinTwit is the largest organic investing community. Real-time format perfect for "we called it" proof posts. |
| **Demographics** | 25-34 (37.5%), 18-24 (32.1%) — 70% under 35. 61% male. Higher-income skew (29% earn $100K+) |
| **Ad targeting** | Interest-based (stocks, trading, investing), follower lookalikes (competitors, FinTwit accounts), keyword targeting |
| **Content types** | Trade results, regime shift alerts, "we called it" proof, contextual replies to influencers |
| **Posting cadence** | 1-2x daily organic, 2-3x/week "We Called It" posts |
| **KPIs** | Impressions, engagement rate (>2% target), profile visits, link clicks to /track-record |

#### Instagram — Brand Credibility + Discovery

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why** | Visual platform for polished charts, carousel education, Reels for discovery outside followers. 81% Millennial usage. |
| **Demographics** | Largest group: 25-34. 1.69B ad reach. Strong with Millennials. |
| **Ad targeting** | Meta's interest/behavior targeting (investing, financial apps, competitor audiences). Lookalike audiences from email list. |
| **Content types** | Chart screenshots, carousel explainers ("How our 3-factor ensemble works"), Reels (30-60s signal recaps), Stories for daily market color |

### Tier 2: Emerging / Organic Only

#### YouTube — Highest Untapped Potential

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why** | #1 platform for BOTH Gen Z (91%) AND Millennials (90%). Finance YouTube is massive and builds deep trust. SEO value compounds over time. |
| **Demographics** | Near-universal adoption across all age groups. Strong 25-45 segment. |
| **Content ideas** | Weekly "Signal Recap" (5-10 min), monthly performance reviews, "How the ensemble works" explainer, regime shift breakdowns |
| **Investment** | Higher production cost (even screen recordings + voiceover work). Consider starting with Shorts (60s) to test before committing to long-form. |
| **When to start** | Month 2-3, after organic X/IG cadence is established |

#### Threads — Cross-Post, Don't Invest

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why** | Low effort to cross-post from X. 25-34 is dominant age group. But no ad platform yet, limited discoverability. |
| **Strategy** | Auto-cross-post from X. Don't create unique content. Re-evaluate if Meta launches Threads ads. |
| **Current status** | Already publishing via "We Called It" engine |

#### Reddit — Organic Credibility Play

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why** | r/stocks, r/investing, r/wallstreetbets are huge retail investor communities. High-intent users. |
| **Strategy** | NOT for ads or self-promotion (will get banned). Participate genuinely in discussions. Share regime analysis when relevant. Build credibility over months. |
| **Risk** | Heavy moderation against self-promotion. Requires authentic, long-term engagement. |
| **When to start** | Month 3+, only with genuine value-add comments |

#### LinkedIn — Professional Credibility

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why** | 47% are 25-34. "I manage my own portfolio" crowd. Higher income skew. Good for B2B angle (RIAs, advisors). |
| **Strategy** | Repurpose performance content. Position as thought leadership on AI + systematic trading. |
| **When to start** | Month 3+, low priority |

### Tier 3: Not Recommended (For Now)

#### Facebook — Wrong Culture

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why not** | Age demographics actually overlap (25-34 is 31%, 35-44 is 22%) but investing culture is weak. Lower intent. Groups are spammy. |
| **Exception** | Could work for retargeting ads (Meta pixel) since it shares Instagram's ad platform. Test as a retargeting-only channel. |

#### TikTok — Too Young, Low Conversion

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Why not** | Skews 18-24 heavily. Great for awareness but terrible for converting paid subscribers. Users have less investable capital and shorter attention spans for subscription commitment. |
| **Exception** | If YouTube Shorts take off, consider cross-posting to TikTok for free reach. Zero ad spend. |

## Paid Advertising Strategy

### Budget Allocation (Starting)

| Channel | % of Budget | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **X/Twitter ads** | 50% | Highest intent audience, FinTwit targeting, proof-of-concept channel |
| **Instagram/Meta ads** | 35% | Broader reach, lookalike audiences from subscriber list, retargeting |
| **YouTube pre-roll** | 15% | Brand awareness, when video assets are ready (Month 2+) |

### Ad Creative Themes

1. **Social proof**: "Our system flagged [STOCK] before it ran +X%. See the full track record."
2. **Risk management**: "289% return with only -15% max drawdown. How systematic signals protect your downside."
3. **AI/tech credibility**: "3-factor ensemble + 7-regime detection. Not another stock tips newsletter."
4. **FOMO/urgency**: "Today's fresh signals are live. Start your free trial."

### Targeting Approach

| Platform | Primary Targeting |
|----------|------------------|
| **X** | Followers of: @unusual_whales, @TrendSpider, @StockTwits, @TradeAlerts. Interests: stock trading, momentum trading, day trading. Keywords: "trading signals", "stock alerts" |
| **Instagram/Meta** | Lookalike audience from email subscriber list. Interests: investing, stock market, financial technology. Behaviors: active investors, brokerage app users |
| **YouTube** | Finance channel viewers, "stock trading" search intent, competitor channel audiences |

### Conversion Funnel

```
Ad impression
  -> Landing page (/track-record or home)
    -> Free trial signup (CC required)
      -> 7-day trial
        -> Onboarding drip emails (5-step, already built)
          -> Paid conversion
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Cost per trial signup (CPT) | <$15 | Varies by platform. X may be lower due to higher intent. |
| Trial -> paid conversion | 3-5% | Benchmark for signal services |
| Customer LTV (12-month) | $240-480 | At $20-40/mo with <5% monthly churn |
| Target CAC:LTV ratio | 1:3+ | Spend up to $80-160 to acquire a customer |
| ROAS breakeven | Month 3-4 | Expect 2-3 month payback on ad spend |

## Brand Tagline Options

Working candidates — pick one for hero, social bios, app store, and ad copy.

| Direction | Tagline | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Edge** | **Your edge, quantified.** | Top pick. Data-driven sophistication, not intimidating. Works everywhere. |
| **Confidence** | Trade with conviction. | Emotional appeal. Strong for ads and social cards. |
| **Confidence** | Know before you go. | Signals arrive before market open. Casual/memorable. |
| **Edge** | Three signals. One decision. | References ensemble (breakout + momentum + regime). Specific. |
| **Proof** | Walk-forward tested. Real results. | Leans into no-hindsight-bias differentiator. |
| **Proof** | Tested forward, not backward. | Subtle dig at competitors who only backtest. |
| **Simplicity** | Signals that do the work. | Appeals to time-strapped audience. |
| **Simplicity** | The signal. You make the call. | Reinforces signals-only + user autonomy. |

### Current Landing Page Hero

- **Badge:** "AI-Powered Ensemble Strategy" / "Timing + Momentum + Risk"
- **Headline:** "Beat the Market with AI-Powered Trading Signals"
- **Subheadline:** "Our Ensemble approach combines three proven factors — timing, momentum quality, and adaptive risk management — into one system that evolves through every market cycle."
- **Sub-sub:** "~15 high-conviction signals per month — quality over quantity"
- **CTAs:** "Start Free Trial" + "View 5-Year Track Record"

## Competitive Positioning

### What We're Not
- Not a stock tips newsletter (we have walk-forward validated results)
- Not a trading education platform (we give actionable signals, not courses)
- Not a robo-advisor (users keep full control, execute via their broker)

### What We Are
- **Systematic signal service** with transparent, auditable track record
- **AI-enhanced** but grounded in quantitative momentum + regime detection
- **Proof-first**: every signal is persisted, tracked, and reviewable

### Key Differentiators for Ad Copy
1. **Walk-forward results** (not backtested) — 289% over 5 years, no hindsight bias
2. **7-regime market intelligence** — adapts to bull, bear, crash, recovery
3. **3-factor ensemble** — not a single indicator, a system
4. **Full transparency** — /track-record page, signal history, trade autopsies
